tbibank.ro is the Romanian digital platform for tbi bank, a "challenger bank" operating primarily in Southeast Europe. Headquartered in Bulgaria, it distinguishes itself from traditional banks by focusing on speed, digital-first solutions, and serving customers who might be underserved by larger financial institutions.

Here is a detailed overview of what they offer and who they are:

1. Core Identity
   Challenger Bank: They operate with a "fintech mindset," meaning they prioritize flexible, fast, and technology-driven banking over traditional, bureaucratic processes.

"Phygital" Model: While they focus heavily on digital channels (online apps, web platforms), they also maintain physical partnerships with retailers, combining physical presence with digital ease.

Background: The bank entered the Romanian market in 2012. It is part of the 4finance Group, one of Europe's largest digital consumer lending groups.

2. Main Services for Individuals
   They are best known in Romania for consumer lending and savings products:

Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL): This is one of their flagship services. They partner with thousands of retailers (online and offline) to allow customers to buy products in installments (often 4 interest-free payments) directly at the point of sale.

Online Deposits: They aggressively compete on interest rates for term deposits (in RON and EUR), often offering some of the highest rates on the market to attract capital. These can usually be opened 100% online.

Personal Loans: They offer quick personal loans (e.g., "Cash Zero," "Auto Loan") with a focus on fast, online approval processes that require minimal paperwork compared to traditional banks.

Mobile App: A dedicated app allows users to manage their loans, deposits, and payments entirely from their phone.

3. Services for Businesses
   Merchant Solutions: They provide "Point of Sale" (POS) financing solutions for retailers. This allows a shop (online or physical) to offer tbi's installment plans to their own customers, which helps increase sales.

SME Financing: They offer credit lines, investment loans, and working capital for Small and Medium Enterprises.

4. Is it Safe?
   Regulation: Even though they act like a fintech, tbi is a fully licensed bank regulated by the Bulgarian National Bank and operates in Romania under EU banking passport rights, supervised by the National Bank of Romania (BNR).

Guarantee: Deposits up to €100,000 are guaranteed by the Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund (BDIF), adhering to EU regulations, which offers the same level of protection as Romanian banks.

In summary: tbibank.ro is a legitimate banking option often chosen by Romanians for shopping in installments (financing purchases at stores like PC Garage, evoMAG, etc.) or for saving money due to their high interest rates on deposits.
